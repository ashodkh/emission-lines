# Mapping Stellar Continua to Emission Lines

I have trained a JAX-implemented neural network on DESI BGS data (https://www.desi.lbl.gov/2023/06/13/the-desi-early-data-release-in-now-available/) to predict optical emission lines of galaxies from the optical continuum. The model weights are in the model folder, and an example of how to use them is shown in the notebooks/tutorial-predicting-ews-from-fluxes.ipynb notebook.
